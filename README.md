# 🌸 Flower Classification Project – Indian Flower Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive **flower classification system** using traditional **computer vision and machine learning techniques**.  
It extracts **texture, color, and shape-based features** from flower images and compares multiple ML classifiers to accurately identify **Indian flower species**.

The project focuses on **feature engineering + classical ML models**, making it ideal for academic evaluation, interviews, and ML fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop a robust flower classification pipeline using **Computer Vision + ML**
- Extract meaningful features from images:
  - Texture (Gabor Filters, LBP)
  - Color (HSV histograms, RGB statistics, color moments)
- Implement and compare multiple machine learning models
- Provide a **reproducible and extensible** classification framework

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Indian Flower Dataset (custom / local)
- **Location:**  
C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\indianflower

- **Structure:**  
Each flower species is stored in a **separate folder**
- **Images:** Color images of Indian flowers
- **Classes:** Automatically extracted from folder names

🛠️ Technical Implementation
1️⃣ Image Preprocessing

Resize images to 128 × 128

Convert images to grayscale for texture analysis

Apply Gaussian filtering (σ = 1) for noise reduction

Perform histogram equalization for contrast enhancement

Preserve color images for color feature extraction

2️⃣ Feature Extraction

Each image is represented using ~560 handcrafted features.

Neighbors (P): 24

Radius (R): 3

Method: uniform

Histogram bins: 26

🔹 Color Features

HSV Color Histogram

Bins: 8 × 8 × 8 (512 features)

Captures hue, saturation, and brightness distribution

RGB Statistics

🔧 Customization Options
1️⃣ Change Image Size
img_size = 128  # Try 64 or 224

2️⃣ Modify Feature Extraction

Tune Gabor filter parameters

Adjust LBP (P, R)

Change HSV histogram bins

3️⃣ Add New Models

Add classifiers from scikit-learn to the models dictionary.

4️⃣ Modify Evaluation Strategy
test_size = 0.2
cv = 10

📈 Performance Optimization Tips
🔹 For Larger Datasets

Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction

Use feature selection techniques

Use incremental learning

🔹 For Higher Accuracy

Add HOG / SIFT features

Apply data augmentation

Use ensemble methods

🔹 For Faster Training

Reduce image size

Reduce feature dimensions

Use Linear SVM instead of RBF
